* Shapes
  * Circle: A circle is a two-dimensional geometric shape characterized by a set of points in a plane 
that are equidistant from a single fixed point called the center. 
The distance from the center to any point on the circle is known as the radius. 
Circles have no corners or angles and are defined solely by the constant radius length and 
the center point. They are often used in mathematics and engineering to describe curves, and 
in everyday life, they can represent objects like wheels and the outline of round objects.

The area of a circle is calculated as:
$$
 A = \pi * radius ^ 2
$$
  * Square: A square is a two-dimensional geometric shape that is a special type of rectangle 
with four equal sides and four right angles. In other words, all sides of a square have the same 
length, and all angles between those sides measure 90 degrees. Squares are symmetrical and exhibit 
uniformity in their properties, making them a fundamental shape in geometry. They are commonly used 
in mathematics, architecture, and design due to their regularity and simplicity, often symbolizing 
concepts like stability and balance.

The area of a square is calculated as:
$$
  A = side ^ 2
$$
