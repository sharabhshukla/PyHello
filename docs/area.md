# Area of various shapes

Certainly! Here's a write-up on the area calculation for a square and a circle:

## Area Calculation for a Square:

A square is a two-dimensional geometric shape characterized by four equal sides and four right angles. To calculate the area of a square, you need to know the length of one of its sides. The formula for finding the area (\(A\)) of a square with side length (\(s\)) is:

$$
A = side ^ 2
$$

In this formula, \(s\) represents the length of one side of the square. To calculate the area, you simply square the length of the side. This is because all four sides of a square are equal in length, so multiplying the side length by itself accounts for the entire area within the square's boundary.

The area of a square is always expressed in square units (e.g., square inches, square meters) because it represents the amount of space enclosed by the square.


## Area Calculation for a Circle:

A circle is a two-dimensional geometric shape defined by all points in a plane that are equidistant from a central point called the center. To calculate the area of a circle, you need to know the radius (\(r\)), which is the distance from the center to any point on the circle's boundary. The formula for finding the area (\(A\)) of a circle with radius (\(r\)) is:

$$
A = \pi r^2
$$

In this formula, \(\pi\) (pi) is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 3.14159. To calculate the area, you square the radius (\(r\)) and multiply it by \(\pi\). This formula derives from the fact that the area of a circle is composed of infinitely small wedges, and the formula sums up the areas of these wedges.

The area of a circle is also expressed in square units, and it represents the total space enclosed by the circular boundary.

In summary, the area calculations for a square and a circle are straightforward mathematical formulas that depend on the dimensions of the shape. For a square, you square the length of one side (\(s^2\)), and for a circle, you square the radius and multiply by \(\pi\) (\(\pi r^2\)). These calculations are essential in various fields, including geometry, engineering, and everyday problem-solving where areas need to be determined.
